## Hot Configuration Reload

Griffin supports live configuration updates without
requiring a process restart.
When the configuration file is modified, Griffin automatically
reloads the updated values and applies them to the running system.

In practice, this means operators can adjust routing rules, ports,
or upstream targets and observe the changes take effect immediately,
all while existing traffic continues to flow uninterrupted.
